We have two planes. The (first PLANE1) is at Barcelona (BCN) and the second (PLANE2) at San Francisco (SFO).
We have two packages. The first (P1) is at BCN and the second (P2) is at SFO.
We have basic operations (load package, fly, unload package).
The goal is have P1 at SFO and P2 at BCN.
To solve it, we will use PDDL with only strips.
